1. Start Jenkins from docker image

You will get initial password to proceed to instalation

You can customize Jenkins by installing suggested plugins or select different plugins

Dont forget to create an admin user

Configuration of Jenkins URL : you can keep as localhost: 8080 or different IP adress as VM. 


2. Login to Jenkins

3. Manually building with maven ( better to do it manually and after with Jenkins)

4. ./mvnw compile - should be fine * success

5. ./ mvnw test - was a problem with path in my case ( I clone repository to /tmp) and later it was fine * success

6. ./ mvnw package - should be fine * success

7. With Build - Snapshot.jar, you can try to manually open the webiste 

8. Change the port to 8081 , because 8080 is Jenkins occupied

9. localhost:8081 - should be a website

Just in case, if you need more explanation , please go to Pluralsight Jetting starting with Jenkins (very good explanation)
